tingle.js
- 20170516: replaced fancybox with this for a modal popup as it's jQuery-free

jquery.base64.min.js
- I THINK once I updated to jquery 2.10+ this broke with a INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR, so I used a new one from here:

mdn.base64.min.js
- first used 20140606 on Core 2015 Set, replaced jquery.base64.min.js I think due to jQuery 2.10+ issue

jlinq.js
- used until 20140711 (during M15) when I replaced it with linq.js

linq.js
- started using on 20140711 (during M15)
- stopped using on 20140808 when it was replaced completely with Underscore (6x faster)

jquery.eventable.js
- used until 20140713 (during M15) when I replaced it with backbone.js events

underscore-min.js
- 20140713: upgraded to 1.6.0

backbone-mins.js
- 20140713: 1.1.2: newly included (during M15) to implement MVC
	-  LOCKED to 1.1.2 as >=1.2.0 introduces bug where it incorrectly runs ProductView.events THEN .initialize()

20170301: converted /util/card data importers to native es6 (no backbone, no jquery)
